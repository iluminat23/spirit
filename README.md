## Composition
The Spirit consists of two boards. The first Board contains an ATMEL MEGA329PA. This board is also connected to the motor. I call this board the temp control board.

The second board contains an Silicon Labs [ZM5202](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/z-wave/500-series-modules/device.zm5202) ([datasheet](/docs/DSH12435-15.pdf)) module with a Silicon Labs SD3502 ([datasheet](/docs/DSH12206-13.pdf)) chip.
